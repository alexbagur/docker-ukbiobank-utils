## ukutils

This is a repo to hold a Docker image for UK Biobank utilities.

By default, UK Biobank will only [provide binaries](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/download.cgi) for Linux and Windows for their utilities.

This Docker image will allow you to run them anywhere you want as long as you have Docker (i.e. OS X).
